# Instabot-api

## Important endpoints:

* API REST Documentation - `localhost:8080/instabot-api/swagger-ui.html#/`

* Manual execution:
  * POST `/follow/processTopFollowers` This will get last photos for a user, then it will collect all comments
and will create a list of the users which will be sorted on specific strategy (e.g. MostCommentsSortingStrategy).
Then the list will be divided in two lists. First 75% will be followed and for the rest 25% we will
collect their last couple of photos and we will choose couple of them to be liked (random or the latest).
  * POST `/like/processTopLikers` This is similar to the previous one, but here we will collect last couple of photos
for specific user and collect all the likers and combine them in one big list to see which ones are
that liked most of them. top 90% we will choose couple of their photos to like back and the other 10%
will be added to be followed.
  * POST `/hashtag` add hashtag to your hashtag list from which you will like photos.
